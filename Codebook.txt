==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data 
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating 
the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed 
to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features 
was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The following files were used to summarise the dataset:
=========================================

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features. This was transformed into column names of the data set.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name. These became labels for the activity factor.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. These became activity factors for the training set.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. These became activity factors for the test set.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. These became factors for the training set.

- 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. These became factors for the test set.

Only the following features were summarised. Other columns from the original data set were removed. Each feature was grouped by 
test subject and activity before being summarized using its mean.
